# An ABM of reproduction cycles in economics

This is the project that Sarah Neuffer and Laura Porak are preparing for the course 
[Agentenbasierte Modellierung in der Ökonomik](https://claudius-graebner.com/teaching/lecture-material/cusanusabm.html), 
which was held by [Claudius Gräbner](https://claudius-graebner.com/) at the Cusanus Hochschule in early 2020.
